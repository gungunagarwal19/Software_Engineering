CineVibe is an AI-powered app designed to revolutionize how people discover movies through personalization and smart recommendations.

It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to understand user input and generate context-aware suggestions and answers.

CineVibe focuses on mood-based discovery, allowing users to search for movies that match their current feelings or vibe.

The app supports natural language queries, so users can simply type or speak things like "I want a feel-good comedy" or "a thriller with a twist ending."

It learns from your watch history, likes, and interactions to continuously improve its recommendation engine.

CineVibe aims to bridge entertainment with AI, offering not just suggestions, but context-rich overviews, trailers, and summaries.

It features a clean and interactive chat-like interface for an intuitive and modern movie browsing experience.

The platform caters to Bollywood, Hollywood, regional, and international films, making it inclusive and diverse.

TV shows and web series are part of the upcoming expansion roadmap for broader content discovery.

CineVibe prioritizes user privacyâ€”your preferences and data are secure and used solely to improve your app experience.

It offers cross-platform support, with launches planned on Android, iOS, and a web version.

CineVibe includes watchlist creation, alerts for new releases, and mood-based filters for quick decisions.

The app supports voice input, making discovery hands-free and seamless.

Social discovery features are in the pipeline, allowing users to see what their friends are watching and recommending.

CineVibe's mission is to make movie discovery personal, intelligent, and joyful, turning your scrolling time into watching time.
